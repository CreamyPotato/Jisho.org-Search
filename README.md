# Jisho.org-Search
C# WinForm Japanese Dictionary Program that uses Jisho.org's JSON based API. Nothing serious, just having fun whether it's useful or not.

Currently this is just some practice for me using JSON.net to parse the online Japanese Dictionary Site Jisho.org's JSON API.
I was bored at work and decided to give it a shot and accidentally made it kind of work so now I will try working on it and expirementing
with it in hopes of creating something that can be useful and convenient for myself in my Japanese language study.

Right now, the site is still more convenient but with time, i'm hoping to create something useful to not just me, but others as well.


UPDATE:
After having not touched this in years, it seems that the method I was using to access Jisho.org's API no longer works.
At some point I'll try to fix it but I have other priorities and projects at the moment.
